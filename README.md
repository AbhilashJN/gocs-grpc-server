# GOCS gRPC server
This is a gRPC server which exposes the apis from the [gocs-core CSGO demo analyzer](https://github.com/AbhilashJN/gocs-core) as gRPC services.

Usage:
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a `.env` file and set the appropriate variables. (See the `env_sample` file for reference.)
4. Run the server without building `go run main.go` or build and run the executable `go build main.go && ./main`.
